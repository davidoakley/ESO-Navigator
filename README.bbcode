[B][SIZE="4"][COLOR="DeepSkyBlue"]A map searching and navigation Add-on[/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]

This is an Add-on designed to make getting from place to place in ESO easier. It provides a context-sensitive tab on the World Map and a sophisticated search box where you can enter wayshrines, zones or other destinations with results appearing as you type.

[B]Navigator[/B] is new! You can see a [url=https://github.com/davidoakley/ESO-Navigator/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20label%3Abug]list of currently known/fixed issues[/url] on GitHub. I would appreciate friendly feedback as to how it can be improved or how it isn't working the way you'd expect. It currently works in [b]English[/b] and is partially localised and tested in [b]French[/b]; other languages may have varying levels of functionality or brokenness... Please get in touch if you'd like to help!

Although not required, [b]Navigator[/b] works best with [url=https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info2103-PerfectPixel.html][b][COLOR="PaleGreen"]PerfectPixel[/COLOR][/b][/url], which expands the map side bar to show a lot more content.

[size=6][b][COLOR="Cyan"]Search Tips[/COLOR][/b][/size]

Search results use the [url=https://github.com/jhawthorn/fzy][b]fzy[/b][/url] algorithm. It attempts to present the best matches first. The following considerations are weighted when sorting:
[LIST][*]It prefers consecutive characters: [b]dag[/b] matches [b]Daggerfall[/b] over [b]Dragonstar[/b].
[*]It prefers matching the beginning of words: [b]cc[/b] matches [b]Clockwork City[/b] over [b]Cradlecrush[/b]
[*]It prefers shorter matches: [b]fortr[/b] matches [b]Brass Fortress[/b] over [b]Fort Redmane[/b].
[*]It prefers shorter candidates: [b]Wayr[/b] matches [b]Wayrest[/b] over [b]Wayrest Sewers[/b].[/LIST]

You can filter a search by typing a prefix:

[list][*][b]p:[/b] or [b]@[/b] - List and filter by [b]players[/b] by username
[*][b]h:[/b] - List and filter by [b]houses[/b]
[*][b]z:[/b] - Jump to the Tamriel map to list all [b]zone[/b] names[/list]

When filtering, press [b][COLOR="LemonChiffon"]Backspace[/COLOR][/b] to delete the filter and return to normal search mode

I've learned a lot about add-on development, API usage and how to solve various sticky problems by reviewing existing add-on code, including excellent travel add-ons [url=https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1089-FasterTravelWayshrinesmenuTeleporter.html]Faster Travel[/url] and [url=https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info2143-BeamMeUp-TeleporterFastTravel.html]BeamMeUp[/url].
